# NearDrop.me

[NearDrop.me](https://neardrop.me): local and remote file sharing in your browser. 

## Additional Features
This project is built on top of the open software [Neardrop](https://github.com/omniashare/snapdrop).  While preserving most of the features of Neardrop, the following features are added:
* Add remote file sharing via user-created rooms
* Allow users to change local device name
* Allow cancellation of a time-consuming file transfer process
* Enhance WebSocket connections to avoid ghost devices

## Notes
A free web server is used to provide local and remote file sharing. In case you find the file transfer process too slow, you can try sharing the files at a later time when the server is less busy.
