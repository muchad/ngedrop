# Ngedrop!

This project began as a modified version of the excellent open-source [neardrop](https://github.com/omniashare/neardrop), which itself is based on the original [snapdrop](https://github.com/snapdrop/snapdrop). 


### Key Enhancements
While preserving the core features of its predecessors, this version introduces several upgrades:

* **üöÄ Robust Connection Stability**: Replaced the manual application-level ping/pong with a low-level WebSocket heartbeat mechanism. This drastically reduces "ghost peers" and accurately detects abrupt disconnects, a common issue on mobile devices.

* **‚ö°Ô∏è Always-On Service**: Implemented a `/ping` health-check endpoint that works with a cron job to keep the free-tier service on free web server alive and prevent it from sleeping.
      

### Notes
This service is hosted on free web server, so the performance may vary depending on traffic. If you experience slowness, please feel free to try again at a later time.
