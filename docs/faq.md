# Frequently Asked Questions

NearDrop.me is built on top of the open software Snapdrop.  Feel free to access the FAQ page of Snapdrop(https://github.com/omniashare/neardrop/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for technical questions.

### Why we create NearDrop.me
As the Snapdrop development team explains in its FAQ, "Snapdrop is a study in radical simplicity" and "Don't be sad if we decline your feature request for the sake of simplicity", we can see that preserving simplicity is the top priority.

Thus, to add any experimental features, it is best to create a new project.  This is why we created NearDrop.me so that we can add more experimental features at will. 

This new version is built on top of Snapdrop and one instance of Snapdrop - [Wulingate](https://www.wulingate.com)
